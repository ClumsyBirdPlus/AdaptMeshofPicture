# AdaptMeshofPicture

This project demonstrates how to use AFEPack's mesh refinement tool to generate and visualize a mesh based on an input image. The process involves adapting the mesh resolution according to the grayscale values of the image.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- AFEPack: A C++ library for adaptive finite element methods.
- OpenCV: A computer vision library for image processing.
